# --- Instructions ---
# - Sort through your spec_helper file. Place as much environment loading
#   code that you don't normally modify during development in the
#   Spork.prefork block.
# - Place the rest under Spork.each_run block
# - Any code that is left outside of the blocks will be ran during preforking
#   and during each_run!
# - These instructions should self-destruct in 10 seconds.  If they don't,
#   feel free to delete them.
